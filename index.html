              <article class="column right" id="info">
                <p>I am sophomore in Computer Science at Century College in White Bear Lake, MN. I currently have plans to transfer
                   to the University of Minnesota with the possiblitity of studying abroad for my
                   senior year. I became interested in programming because of my uncle. One day, he 
                   tried to explain to me the intricacies of programming. But alas, I was beyond confused,
                   I was angry, angry that I couldn't understand a word that he was saying. Programming 
                   felt like something that I should know everyting about, but I knew nothing. 
                   I made a promise to myself that I would learn how to program, to this day I 
                   do not know why I became so determined to learn about programming. But it has set me 
                   on a intellectual journey that has humbled me in every way possible. I still have
                   much to learn, and I know that I can never know everything about programming, but 
                   I'll try. Some other things to know about me is that I can speak three languages! I am
                   fluent in English and Spanish, and I am greatly conversational in Norwegian. Another
                   thing to know about me is that I am a massive fan and partaker in martial arts.
                   I study Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at Alliance Jiu Jitsu in Hudson, Wisconsin. And I've 
                   been boxing ever since I could hold my hands up to my head, and for the past 3 years
                   I've been transitioning my boxing skills into Muay Thai. For programming, I am most 
                   experienced in Java and Python. And currently I am sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
